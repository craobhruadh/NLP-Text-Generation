      "Roman streets; As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\n",
      "Disasters in the sun; and the moist star, Upon whose influence\n",
      "Neptune’s empire stands, Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "LAERTES. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come, It warms the very\n",

      "\n",

      "KING. It falls right. You have been talk’d of since your travel much,\n",
      "And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality Wherein they say you shine.\n",
      "Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that\n",

      "\n",
      "LAERTES. What part is that, my lord?\n",

      "gallant Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat, And to such\n",
      "wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorps’d and\n",

      "LAERTES. I know him well. He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the\n",
      "nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "KING. He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report\n",
      "For art and exercise in your defence, And for your rapier most\n",
      "especially, That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed If one could\n",
      "match you. The scrimers of their nation He swore had neither motion,\n",
      "guard, nor eye, If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet\n",

      "\n",
      "LAERTES. Why ask you this?\n",
      "\n",
      "KING. Not that I think you did not love your father, But that I know\n",
      "love is begun by time, And that I see, in passages of proof, Time\n",
      "qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame\n",
      "of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a\n",
      "like goodness still, For goodness, growing to a pleurisy, Dies in his\n",
      "own too much. That we would do, We should do when we would; for this\n",
      "‘would’ changes, And hath abatements and delays as many As there are\n",
      "tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this ‘should’ is like a\n",
